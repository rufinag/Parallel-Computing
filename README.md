# Parallel-Computing

A collection of parallel codes for random mathematical formulae using OpenMP

## Covariance
### Sequential.h:
Functions to carry out the calculation of the covariance of a matrix sequentially
### Parallel.h:
Functions to carry out the calculation of the covariance of a matrix parallely
### pdc.cpp
Main file to test parellel.h and sequential.h
